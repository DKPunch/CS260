This is the first assignment from my Dat Structures class. We are required to create a program that uses a doubly threaded linked list to manipulate data. The data includes voter names, party affiliation and intensity of political feeling towards the upcomming election. The program will take in data, sort by both Name and Intensity levels and also have functions to insert and delete new voter information.
